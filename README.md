# ANTSD Solutions in Python

I'm working through Mike X Cohen's book [Analyzing Neural Time Series Data: Theory and Practice](http://mikexcohen.com/#books), solving the exercises in Python with the help of packages like [MNE](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html).

The images in the book were created using Matlab code available from the book's website. Lyndon Duong has re-created those images in Python [here](https://github.com/lyndond/Analyzing_Neural_Time_Series).

Alberto Ara has implemented the book's computation of a surface Laplacian in Python [here](https://github.com/alberto-ara/Surface-Laplacian).
